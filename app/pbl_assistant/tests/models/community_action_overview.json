  "overview": "The Community Action Project engages students as civic investigators and changemakers, starting with their own curiosities about community challenges and building toward authentic action.\n\nLearning Journey: Students begin by wondering about problems they notice in their community, then dive deep through stakeholder interviews, data exploration, and collaborative research. They develop and test creative solutions with community feedback before presenting action plans to real audiences who can implement change.\n\nStudent Experience: This project honors multiple ways of learning and expressing ideas\u2014from visual storytelling to hands-on prototyping to community dialogue facilitation. Students choose their focus areas, research methods, and presentation formats while building genuine relationships with community stakeholders.\n\nFlexible Implementation: Scales from 3-day community problem explorations to semester-long impact initiatives. Works equally well with small collaborative teams or networked connections across multiple classrooms. Can adapt to any delivery mode while maintaining authentic community engagement.\n\nThe project transforms students from passive learners into active citizens who see themselves as capable of creating meaningful change in their communities.",
